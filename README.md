# iUPB
iUPB is an extensible, open-source rails3 web-application for the University of Paderborn: www.i-upb.de.
Students and staff use it to get current information about restaurants, busses, weather, they manage their courses and post ads to a pinboard.

The app uses Bootstrap and is accessible with all major browsers and operating systems.
We also created two apps for iOS and Android. Check them out as well (search for "iUPB").
