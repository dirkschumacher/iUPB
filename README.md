# iUPB
iUPB is an extensible, open-source rails3 web-application for the University of Paderborn: [www.i-upb.de](http://www.i-upb.de).
Students and staff use it to get current information about restaurants, busses, weather, they manage their courses and post ads to a pinboard.

The app uses Bootstrap and is accessible by all major browsers and operating systems.
We also created two apps for [iOS](https://github.com/yippie-io/iUPB-iOS-App) and [Android](https://github.com/yippie-io/iUPB-Android). Check them out as well!
